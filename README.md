## Where Are The Manuscripts, Rulesets, Extensions and Modules?

Public-ready releases of the Manuscripts (`.pdf`), VTT Game Systems, etc, can be found in the **releases** folder (when we have something to release).

## A Living Project

We've all heard the term "living document", which means that a given document can and does change over time as things around it change. Well, this is a "living project" - every part of it, from the "final" Manuscripts, Rulesets, Extensions and Modules through to the Project Documentation, is open to change and improvement by our Contributors. That's one reason all of our files here on the Project Website have a version number (including this one). So if you think you've got a better idea or way of doing something that the Project covers, or if the Project isn't covering something that you feel it should, then become a Contributor and write up your idea or process and submit it. We welcome all ideas here at the UGE-RPG Project - your submission might not meet with the Project's approval, design or goals, but then again, it just might.

## How To Report A Bug, Offer A Suggestion Or Help Out Without Becoming A Contributor

You may want to help us out by reporting a bug or in some other way but you don't want to become a Contributor (see below) - that's OK, we'll take any help we can get. Please see our [**Non-Contributor Help**](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/Non-Contributor_Help.md) document for how to do this - and thanks!

## How To Contribute

If you are interested in helping out then please see our [**How To Contribute**](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/How_To_Contribute.md) document. The Project needs all sorts of people with all sorts of skills: Artists, Cartographers, Rules Developers, Programmers, Adventure Writers, Editors, Proofreaders, Translators, Testers, Lawyers, Publishers - you name it, we need it! So please, come and join us and help leave your mark on the RPG Hobby.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
