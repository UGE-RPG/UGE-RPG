# Why We Don't Use Author Tags

Version 1.0.0

Author Tags are typically comments in code files (and elsewhere) where the author lists their name and other identifying information in an effort to gain attribution for the contents of the file. The UGE-RPG Project does not use Author Tags, and here's why (as put by Sander Striker, paraphrased):

*At the Apache Software foundation we discourage the use of author tags in source code. There are various reasons for this, apart from the legal ramifications. Collaborative development is about working on projects as a group and caring for the project as a group. Giving credit is good, and should be done, but in a way that does not allow for false attribution, even by implication. There is no clear line for when to add or remove an author tag. Do you add your name when you change a comment? When you put in a one-line fix? Do you remove other author tags when you refactor the code and it looks 95% different? What do you do about people who go about touching every file, changing just enough to make the virtual author tag quota, so that their name will be everywhere?*

*There are better ways to give credit, and our preference is to use those. From a technical standpoint author tags are unnecessary; if you wish to find out who wrote a particular piece of code, the version control system can be consulted to figure that out. Author tags also tend to get out of date. Do you really wish to be contacted in private
about a piece of code you wrote five years ago and were glad to have forgotten?*
